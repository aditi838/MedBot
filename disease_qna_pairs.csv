Antimicrobial resistance,"How does the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals lead to antimicrobial resistance in humans?
﻿","The high volume of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, particularly in settings of intensive animal production. In some countries, the total amount of antibiotics used in animals is 4 times larger than the amount used in humans. In many countries much of the antibiotics used in animals are for growth promotion and prevention of disease, not to treat sick animals. These bacteria can be transmitted from animals to humans via direct contact between animals and humans, or through the food chain and the environment. Antimicrobial-resistant infections in humans can cause longer illnesses, increased frequency of hospitalization, and treatment failures that can result in death. Some types of bacteria that cause serious infections in humans have already developed resistance to most or all of the available treatments and we are running out of treatment options for some types of infection. WHO recommends an overall reduction in use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to help preserve their effectiveness for human medicine.

Antimicrobial resistance,Why is antimicrobial resistance important for food safety?,"Many of the bacteria (such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli) carried by animals can also cause disease in people. These bacteria, which are frequently antimicrobial-resistant, can contaminate our food supply from farm to fork, such as through slaughtering and processing. Fruits and vegetables may also be contaminated by such bacteria at the farm or later through cross-contamination. We know about this because we can link drug-resistant bacteria isolated from sick people to an agricultural source through DNA fingerprinting. Over 400 000 people die each year from foodborne diseases, with over one-third of these deaths occurring in children under 5 years of age. The vast majority of foodborne illnesses are caused by microbes, including bacteria, according to WHO estimates . If these bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, it will become impossible to treat them and more people will die from foodborne diseases.

Antimicrobial resistance,Do the Guidelines call for a total ban of the preventive use of antibiotics in animals?,"Recommendation No.3 of the new guidelines says that antibiotics should not be used as a preventive tool in the absence of disease in animals. The use of antimicrobials for disease prevention may be justified when a veterinary professional judges that there is a high risk of spread of a particular infectious disease, if such a judgement is made on the basis of recent culture and sensitivity testing results. The antimicrobials used should start with those of least importance for human health, i.e. start with classes not used in humans, and then as listed on the WHO List of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine (important and then highly important). Antimicrobials classified by WHO as critically important for human medicine should be used in animals only when the most recent culture and sensitivity results of bacteria known to have caused the disease indicate that the critically important antimicrobial is the only option. The WHO guidelines address the use of antibiotics used in human medicine. Antibiotics that are used only in animals are outside the scope of the guidelines. All possible means, such as improved hygiene and vaccination, should be taken to reduce the risks of food producing animals contracting infections and therefore reduce the need for antibiotics.

Autism,What is autism?,"Autism – also referred to as autism spectrum disorder – constitutes a diverse group of conditions related to development of the brain. Characteristics may be detected in early childhood, but autism is often not diagnosed until much later. Autism is characterised by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations. The abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others require life-long care and support. Autism often has an impact on education and employment opportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant. Societal attitudes and the level of support and services provided by local and national authorities are important factors determining the quality of life of people with autism.

Burns,What were the main radionuclides to which people were exposed?,"The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed were iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium137. Iodine-131 has a short radioactive half-life (eight days) and can be transferred to humans rapidly
through the air and by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. Iodine becomes
localized in the thyroid gland. Because many infants and children consume relatively large quantities of
milk and dairy products, and because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their
metabolism, exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults. Caesium isotopes have longer half-lives (caesium-134 and caesium-137 have half-lives of 2 years and
30 years, respectively). There are thus longer-term exposures to these radionuclides through the
ingestion pathway and through external exposure from their deposition on the ground.

Burns,What were the impacts on health from Chernobyl?,"In 2006, WHO published its report summarizing the data from two decades of research on the health
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It included reviews of studies carried out on cancers, noncancer diseases, immune and genetic effects, and reproductive and children’s health, as well as
evidence-based recommendations for national health authorities and for further research. In 2011, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)
published a report entitled ""Health effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident."" The findings
were based on more than two decades of experimental and analytical studies of the health
consequences of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. The report is the most comprehensive
evaluation to date of exposure levels and health effects from the Chernobyl accident. Radiation sickness According to the UNSCEAR report, the Chernobyl accident caused a number of severe radiation
effects almost immediately. Of 600 workers present on the site during the early morning of 26 April
1986, 134 received very high doses (0.8-16 Grey) and suffered from acute radiation sickness. Of those,
28 workers died in the first three months. Radiation-induced cataracts Among those who survived radiation sickness, recovery took several years. Many of them developed
radiation-induced cataracts in the first few years after the accident. Recent studies of the recovery
operation workers indicate that opacities of the eye lens might result from radiation doses lower than
previously expected (about 500 mSv). Cancers For the last two decades, attention has been focused on investigating the association between exposure
to radionuclides released in the Chernobyl accident and late effects, in particular thyroid cancer. In the
first few months after the accident, radiation dose exposures to the thyroid received were particularly
high in children and adolescents living in Belarus, Ukraine and the most affected regions of the Russian
Federation, and in those who drank milk with high levels of radioactive iodine. By 2005, more than
6,000 thyroid cancer cases had been diagnosed in this group. It is most likely that a large fraction of
these thyroid cancers are attributable to radioiodine intake. Furthermore, it is expected that increases in
thyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident will continue for many more years, although
long-term increases are difficult to quantify. Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed at a young age,
there is some indication of increased leukaemia and cataract incidence among workers. Otherwise,
there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the incidence of solid cancers or leukaemia due to radiation
in the exposed populations. There also is no convincing proof so far of increases in other nonmalignant disorders that are related to ionizing radiation. Among 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked between 1986 and 1990, the
average dose was 120 mSv (ranging from 20 to 500 mSv). That cohort is still potentially at risk of
cancer and other diseases and their health continues to be closely followed. Among Russian recovery operation workers with higher average doses (above 200 mSv), evidence is
emerging of some increase in the incidence of leukaemia. Based on other studies, the annual incidence
of radiation-induced leukaemia would be expected to fall within a few decades after exposure. There is a tendency to attribute increases in rates of all cancers over time to the Chernobyl accident, but
it should be noted that increases in cancer in the affected areas were also observed before the accident.
Moreover, a general increase in mortality has been reported in recent decades in most areas of the
former Soviet Union, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the accident-related studies. Persistent psychological or mental health problems Several international studies have reported that exposed populations, compared to controls, had anxiety
symptom levels that were twice as high and were more likely to report multiple unexplained physical
symptoms and subjective poor health. Given that rates of mental health problems increase after a
disaster and may manifest years after the event, WHO recommends improving availability and access
to normal community mental health services in disaster-affected areas. One of the objectives of the on-going UN inter-agency International Chernobyl Research and
Information Network (ICRIN) project is to alleviate the stigma of psychological trauma in
society, encourage self-reliance, and empower local communities to take control over their own lives.
One of the ways to achieve these goals is to promote healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and
healthy diet, and to explain the environmental, behavioural, and other risks for various chronic diseases,
including cancer. Concerns related to fertility and birth defects In the Chernobyl-affected regions, there is no evidence of decreased fertility among males or females in
the general population. However, birth rates may be lower in contaminated areas because of a high rate
of medical abortions. Since 1986, there has been a reported increase in congenital malformations in both contaminated and
uncontaminated areas of Belarus which predated Chernobyl and may be the result of increased
registration of such cases. Based on dose levels to which the majority of the population was exposed,
there is unlikely to be a major effect on the number of stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery
complications, or the overall health of children, but monitoring remains important. Potential impact on health in other European countries So far, there has been no clear evidence of any measurable increases in adverse health effects related to
the Chernobyl radiation in countries outside of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

Cholera,How can I make sure that the water I have at home is safe to drink?,"There are several things you can do to make sure that your water is safe to drink at home. If it's well-monitored, water piped into your home is usually safe to drink. If your water looks dirty or cloudy, physically remove pathogens by filtering your water using a water filter, clean cloth, paper towel or coffee filter. After filtering, you should still boil or disinfect your water. You can boil your water for at least one minute before drinking. After boiling, store drinking water safely in a clean, tightly sealed container to avoid recontamination. You can also disinfect your water to make it safe to drink. After filtering, use household water treatment chemicals following the manufacturer’s instructions. If household water chemicals are not available, add 3 to 5 drops of chlorine (such as 5–9% unscented household bleach) to one litre of water. Wait at least 30 minutes before using. You can also drink bottled water.

Cholera,Is there a cholera vaccine?,"There is a vaccine available against cholera. It is called the oral cholera vaccine, or OCV. Being vaccinated with OCV reduces your chances of getting infected with cholera. Vaccination is a critical tool to stopping cholera, but access to safe water and sanitation is the most important thing to protect communities. OCV is safe and effective. Rare side effects include nausea, vomiting and mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The oral cholera vaccine can be given to children over one year and adults. It is safe for you to receive the oral cholera vaccine if you are pregnant. The cholera vaccine is an oral vaccine, meaning it needs to be swallowed. In a 2-dose schedule, the doses should be taken at least 2 weeks apart (and not more than 6 months apart). This provides you with protection for at least 3 years.

Cholera,How can I use oral rehydration solution to treat someone with cholera?,"Oral rehydration solution can successfully treat 80% of patients. If someone is dehydrated, drinking water alone is not enough to help them recover. This is why using oral rehydration salts is important. ORS is solution prepared by mixing 1 sachet of oral rehydration salts in 1 litre of safe water.  Follow the instructions on the packet. If you don’t have oral rehydration salt sachets, you can make the same solution by mixing: half a teaspoon of salt 6 teaspoons of sugar 1 litre of safe drinking-water or lightly salted rice water. If you don’t have access to sachets or sugar and salt for the home-made solution, the most important thing is to keep the patient drinking anything and to seek care fast.

Cholera,Someone in my household has cholera. How can I avoid others getting infected?,"The risk of you catching cholera when caring for a sick person is low if you take some basic measures to protect yourself: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and safe water after taking care, touching the clothes, or bedding of the sick person. Wash the sick person’s bedding or clothing away from drinking-water sources. Avoid direct contact with stools and vomit of the sick person. Place all waste in a toilet and ensure the latrine is properly disinfected. If the sick person is using the household or community toilet, make sure it is cleaned and disinfected thoroughly after each use. Don’t let the sick person prepare food. Mothers should continue to breastfeed infants and young children even if they have been diagnosed with cholera. Take care to avoid getting infected via the clothing and bedding of a sick person: Clean clothing and bedding by: machine washing between 60–90 °C with household laundry detergent following by a complete drying cycle or drying in direct sunlight; or if machine washing is not available, immerse in a large container of water, stir for 10 minutes and scrub to remove dirt (taking care to avoid splashes). Disinfect clothing and bedding by: immersing in boiling water for 5 minutes; or immersing in water with a 0.2% solution of chlorine for at least 10 minutes then rinsing. To make 0.2% solution of chlorine: If you are starting with 4% liquid bleach, mix bleach to water with a ratio of 1 : 19.

Cholera,What should I expect if I or a loved one goes to a health facility/cholera treatment centre?,"When a patient arrives at a health facility, they will be assessed by a health worker to see whether they have cholera. In some cases, this may include a test, usually of the stool (poo). A health worker will collect a small sample of stool (poo) either from a bucket/container or directly using a swab. Collection using a swab may be uncomfortable if it is from your body directly but will not be painful. The sample is then either sent to the laboratory for testing or tested in the facility itself using a rapid test. Getting the test results can take less than an hour to a few days, depending on the type of test. In cholera treatment centres, health workers will help to make sure the patient remains hydrated using oral rehydration salts. If the patient is severely ill, he/she may be given antibiotics. Children may receive zinc tablets.

(toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of 
throat. This can block the airway making it hard to breathe or swallow 
and create a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to 
enlarged lymph nodes. The toxin may also get into the blood stream 
causing complications that may include inflammation and damage of the 
heart muscle, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding 
problems due to low blood platelets. The damaged heart muscles may 
result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may

There is a very small number of people who have managed to control the HIV infection without ART and are called ‘elite-controllers’. This situation is very rare and most people will need ART to avoid becoming ill.

HIV and AIDS,How is HIV transmitted?,"HIV is found in certain bodily fluids of people living with HIV, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids and breastmilk. HIV can be transmitted by: unprotected vaginal or anal sex, and, in very rare cases, through oral sex with a person living with HIV; blood transfusion of contaminated blood; sharing of needles, syringes, other injecting equipment, surgical equipment or other sharp instruments; and from a mother living with HIV to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. A person living with HIV who is taking ART and whose viral load is “undetectable” will not transmit HIV to their sexual partner/s.

HIV and AIDS,How is HIV infection treated?,"While there is no cure for HIV infection, it can be treated using antiretroviral drugs, which work by stopping the replication of the virus. ART can reduce the level of virus to such low levels in the body that the immune system will function normally, and a person living with HIV can enjoy good health, provided they adhere to treatment and the treatment remains effective. People living with HIV are also much less likely to transmit the virus to others when treatment is working.

HIV and AIDS,What does “undetectable” mean?,"Evidence from several studies show that people living with HIV who have an “undetectable” viral load cannot pass HIV on to others. A person is “undetectable” when ART has reduced the level of virus in their body to such low levels that it cannot be detected by normal viral load tests. Monitoring of viral load, and confirmation of an undetectable viral load is often undertaken by a healthcare professional as part of the routine medical care for people with HIV. In many low- and middle-income countries, viral load tests may not be consistently or routinely available, so many people do not benefit from the knowledge that they are undetectable. They can be assured, however, that the risk of transmitting HIV is greatly reduced when they adhere to treatment, and when treatment is started without delay.

HIV and AIDS,What illnesses can affect people living with HIV?,"ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives by ensuring that their immune system remains healthy. In certain settings, however, many people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, not on treatment, or not taking consistent treatment, and, as a result their HIV disease progresses. People with HIV who develop severe immunodeficiency and are not on antiretroviral treatment frequently develop severe opportunistic infections and some rare cancers as Kaposi Sarcoma. Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one cause of death among people living with HIV in Africa, and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Routine TB-symptom screening and early initiation of ART can greatly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Other common HIV coinfections include hepatitis B and C in some populations. HIV infection can result in a range of health problems. As people living with HIV age and live longer, non-AIDS defining illnesses are becoming more common. These include heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

HIV and AIDS,How can people get tested for HIV?,"Testing for HIV is the only way to know if a person has HIV or not. HIV can be diagnosed using rapid diagnostic tests that provide results within minutes. However, such results should only be considered as a full diagnosis following review and confirmation
    by a qualified health worker. Knowledge of one’s HIV-positive status has two important benefits: People who test positive can take steps to get treatment, care and support before symptoms appear, which can prolong life and prevent health complications for many years. People who are aware of their status can take precautions to prevent the transmission of HIV to others. WHO recommends that HIV tests be made available in all health facilities and through a range of community settings.  People can also use HIV self-test kits to test themselves. People using self-tests and have a positive result should always get this confirmed at a health centre.

HIV and AIDS,What is the relationship between HIV and other STIs?,"HIV infection is more likely to occur if a person has another sexually transmitted infection (STI) and vice-versa. The probability of infection by HIV or other sexually transmitted pathogens significantly increases when people engage in risky sexual behaviours (e.g. no condom use, unprotected sex with multiple partners; sex under the influence of drugs and alcohol). Additionally, sores and inflammations from some STIs facilitate HIV infection. Evidence indicates that genital herpes (HSV-2) almost triples the risk of acquiring HIV in both men and women. Also, women living with HIV are at high risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer, among several other examples.

HIV and AIDS,What is the intersection between HIV and monkeypox  ?,"People living with HIV may be at risk of developing monkeypox (mpox) because of weak immune systems. There is some evidence that being immunocompromised may increase your risk of becoming infected if you are exposed, and of having serious illness or dying from mpox. However, more data is needed to understand this fully. Many people with mpox in the current outbreak are also living with HIV, but there have been relatively few severe cases of mpox, likely because in most cases their HIV infection was well-controlled. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a high prevalence of HIV infection (52%; 14 573/28 006) has been reported among cases with known HIV status. Monkeypox and HIV share common behavioural risk factors such as transmission through sexual contact. Consideration should be given to testing any person with monkeypox infection for HIV infection if their status is not already known. People with multiple sexual partners, including people who are living with HIV, are encouraged to take steps to reduce their risk of being exposed to mpox by avoiding close contact with anyone who has symptoms and by avoiding high-risk situations where multiple contacts may occur even with persons who may not realize they have mpox.

Hepatitis B,What is hepatitis?,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact. Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer.

Hepatitis B,What are the different hepatitis viruses?,"Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.

Leishmaniasis,What is leishmaniasis?,"Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by any species of Leishmania parasite. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female sandfly. In most cases, a person who is infected by the parasite has neither symptoms nor signs of infection and is not considered to have leishmaniasis. Although there are some 20 different parasites that cause the disease, there are only three different types of leishmaniasis. The most common type (CL) causes skin lesions, mainly nodules or painless ulcers. The second type (VL, also known as kala-azar) is a life-threatening disease that causes anaemia (deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells), fever, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen and significant weight loss. VL is invariably fatal if left untreated. The third type (MCL, or mucosal leishmaniasis alone) destroys the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues.

Leishmaniasis,How are Leishmania parasites transmitted?,"Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of a tiny –2–3 mm long – female insect vector, the phlebotomine sandfly. There are some 800 known phlebotomine species, but only about 30 have been found to transmit Leishmania parasites. Only female sandflies can transmit the parasites; they need blood for their eggs to develop and become infected with Leishmania when they suck blood from an infected person or animal. Over a period of 4–25 days, the parasites develop in the sandfly. When the infectious female sandfly then feeds on a fresh source of blood, it inoculates the person or animal with the parasite, and the transmission cycle is completed. Phlebotomine sandflies are found throughout the intertropical and temperate regions of the world . The female sandfly lays its eggs in the burrows of certain rodents, the bark of old trees, ruins, cracks in the walls of houses, animal shelters and household rubbish, where the larvae can find the organic matter, heat and humidity they need to develop. In its search for blood (usually in the evening and at night), the female sandfly can cover a distance of up to several hundred metres around its habitat.

Leishmaniasis,Why is leishmaniasis important?,"The different types of leishmaniasis last months or years, causing stigmatization, stress, mutilation, weakness, prostration or eventual death if treatment is not available, depending on the causative parasite and the underlying condition of the patient. Since the disease can start as a mild, slowly progressing condition, it may take a long time before patients seek medical care or before they are diagnosed by a health practitioner who may not be familiar with the disease or where there are no appropriate health services close to where patients reside. Leishmaniasis is closely linked to poverty. Factors that increase the risk of infection include poor housing conditions and environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures, and economically driven migration and employment that bring nonimmune people into contact with infected sandflies. Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk of an infected person progressing to clinical manifestations of the disease. Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis are expensive when they are not offered free of charge in the public sector. Consequently, families must sell their assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcing the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. Public investment in leishmaniasis would decrease the burden of the disease and alleviate poverty.

Leishmaniasis,What are the signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and PKDL?,"VL, or kala-azar, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. The main signs are prolonged irregular bouts of fever, enlarged spleen and/or loss of weight. Other signs and symptoms include anaemia, enlarged liver, cough, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, lack specificity and mimic those of malaria, malnutrition, typhoid, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and other systemic diseases. Signs of malnutrition manifest with the progression of disease, with intercurrent [1] infections. In areas co‐endemic for malaria, kala-azar should be suspected when fever lasts for 2 weeks or longer and no response has been observed with antimalarial medicines (assuming that drug‐resistant malaria has been ruled out). PKDL is characterized by patchy and raised hypopigmented rashes. It mainly occurs in areas endemic for L. donovani in East Africa and South Asia. Late manifestations are plaques, papules or nodular and infiltrative lesions, especially on the face. Most PKDL cases occur in patients previously treated for VL. The macules are often confused with vitiligo or leprosy. [1] Infection that occurs during, and modifies the course of, another disease.

Leishmaniasis,What are the signs and symptoms of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis?,"CL is the most common form of leishmaniasis. The clinical spectrum is very broad and varies between and within endemic regions and depends upon several factors including parasite species or immunological status or type of zoonotic cycle involved. Classically, a typical lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site of inoculation of the bite of the infected sandfly that grows slowly to develop a painless ulcer with surrounding induration. Lesions may not heal and require specific treatment, or spontaneously heal gradually over months or years, often resulting in a disfiguring scar with altered pigmentation. Lesions lack specificity and closely resemble many skin conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis, fungal infection, impetigo, leprosy, psoriasis, tropical ulcer, venous leg ulcers, verruca or zona. MCL lesions can lead to partial or total destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. Some patients have mucosal lesions without cutaneous involvement.

These methods include serological tests or microscopic demonstration of parasites, culture or PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Parasite identification remains the gold standard of diagnosis. In areas endemic for VL, the disease can be diagnosed at primary health care level or in rural district hospitals using the rK39-based rapid diagnostic test, which produces results in less than 30 minutes. For PKDL, diagnosis is generally clinical and can be confirmed by skin smears or skin biopsies. CL is usually diagnosed clinically in highly endemic areas where only one type of infection exists. It is mandatory to obtain a parasitological confirmation of the diagnosis before engaging in a systemic, potentially highly toxic antileishmanial treatment. The same procedure is recommended before engaging in a local treatment.

Leishmaniasis,What is the treatment against leishmaniasis?,"The various clinical forms of leishmaniasis are either life‐threatening (if untreated) or disfiguring in a proportion of patients.

In certain cases, supportive treatment such as nutritional supplementation or rehydration blood transfusion may be required before starting therapy. Wherever possible, cases should be managed under medical supervision. VL is a life-threatening condition, and the aim of the treatment is to cure the patient, reduce the risk of relapse and reduce transmission of resistant parasites.

Infants and children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk. Other vulnerable groups include people entering areas with intense malaria transmission who have not acquired partial immunity from long exposure to the disease, or who are not taking chemopreventive therapies, such as migrants, mobile populations and travellers. Some people in areas where malaria is common will develop partial immunity. While it never provides complete protection, partial immunity reduces the risk that malaria infection will cause severe disease. For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk.

Malaria,What treatments are available for malaria?,"Malaria is a treatable disease. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarial medicines available today and the mainstay of recommended treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest malaria parasite globally. ACTs combine 2 active pharmaceuticals with different mechanisms of action, including derivates of artemisinin extracted from the plant Artemisia annua and a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites
    during the first 3 days of treatment, while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites. As no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the market for several years, the efficacy of ACTs must be preserved, which is why WHO recommends that treatment should only be administered if a person tests positive for malaria. WHO does not support the promotion or use of Artemisia plant material (whether teas, tablets or capsules) for the prevention or treatment of malaria. The emergence and spread of artemisinin partial resistance – defined as delayed clearance after treatment with a drug containing an artemisinin – and resistance to ACT partner drugs are significant threats to efforts aimed at reducing the global burden of malaria. In Africa, artemisinin partial resistance is now confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania and is suspected in Ethiopia, Sudan, Namibia and Zambia. Although studies generally show high efficacy of ACTs, concerns remain regarding both the quality and coverage of efficacy data. As part of the WHO strategy to respond to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa , WHO calls on malaria endemic countries and global malaria partners to strengthen the surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance, and to ensure that the most effective treatments are selected for national treatment policy.

Malaria,Is it dangerous to travel to places where malaria is endemic?,"People who have no partial immunity to malaria are at higher risk of contracting the disease. This includes travellers from non-endemic countries entering areas of high transmission as well as people in malaria-endemic countries living in areas where there is little or no transmission. As symptoms often do not present for 10 to 15 days after infection, travellers may return to their home country before exhibiting signs of the disease. Doctors in non-endemic areas may not recognize the symptoms, causing potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or available in all countries. Chemoprophylaxis can be used as a preventive therapy prior to travelling in endemic areas. When combined with the use of insecticide-treated nets and the repeated application of a topical repellent to prevent mosquito bites, it significantly lowers the risk of infection. If a person has taken chemoprophylaxis as a preventive measure, the same medicine should not be used for treatment if infection occurs. Travellers are encouraged to consult a doctor or their national disease control centre prior to departure to determine the appropriate preventive measures.

Malaria,How can malaria be prevented?,"Malaria is a preventable disease. 1.	Vector control interventions. Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission. Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses and other domestic structures. For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is the most practical vector control intervention. WHO maintains a list vector control products that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality. More information on vector control 2.	Chemopreventive therapies and chemoprophylaxis . Although designed to treat patients already infected with malaria, some antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent the disease. Current WHO-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies for people living in endemic areas include intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, perennial malaria chemoprevention, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for school-aged children. Chemoprophylaxis drugs are also given to travellers before entering an area where malaria is endemic and can be highly effective when combined with insecticide-treated nets.

Malaria is a preventable disease.
1.	Vector control interventions. Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission. Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses and other domestic structures. For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is the most practical vector control intervention. WHO maintains a list vector control products that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality.

Malaria,Is there a vaccine against malaria?,"In 2021, WHO recommended the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) vaccine to prevent malaria among children living in regions with moderate-to-high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. Vaccines are now being rolled out in routine childhood immunization programmes across Africa. Malaria vaccines in Africa are expected to save tens of thousands of young lives every year. The highest impact will be achieved, however, when the vaccines are introduced alongside a mix of other WHO-recommended malaria interventions such as bed nets and chemoprophylaxis.

Malaria,Can malaria be eliminated?,"The vision of WHO and the global malaria community is a world free of malaria. This vision will be achieved progressively by countries eliminating malaria from their territories and implementing effective measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission. Malaria-endemic countries are situated at different points along the road to elimination. The rate of progress depends on the strength of the national health system, the level of investment in malaria elimination strategies and other factors, including biological determinants, the environment and the social, demographic, political and economic realities of a particular country. Over the last 2 decades, significant progress has been achieved towards malaria elimination. According to the latest World malaria report , 25 countries had fewer than 10 cases of the disease in 2023, up from 4 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria (a case contracted locally with no evidence of importation from another endemic country) are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination . Since 2015, 14 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), El Salvador (2021), China (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023), Cabo Verde (2024), Egypt (2024) and Georgia (2025).

Malnutrition,What is malnutrition?,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is undernutrition, which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer).

Malnutrition,What are the consequences of malnutrition?,"Malnutrition affects people in every country. Around 890 million adults worldwide are living with obesity, while 390 million are underweight. An estimated 35.5 million children under the age of 5 years are overweight, while some 150 million are stunted. Adding to this burden are the 605 million or 31% of women of reproductive age around the world affected by anaemia. Many families cannot afford or access enough nutritious foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt are cheaper and more readily available, leading to a rapid rise in the number of children and adults who are overweight and obese, in poor as well as rich countries. It is quite common to find undernutrition and overweight within the same community, household or even individual – it is possible to be both overweight and micronutrient deficient, for example.

Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Measles is a highly contagious and potentially serious disease. Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. One in 5 children infected with the measles virus may develop severe complications. Complications can include: blindness encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage) severe diarrhoea and related dehydration ear infections that can lead to permanent deafness severe breathing problems including pneumonia. Measles infection has also been shown to weaken a person’s immune system, making it more difficult for them to fight off other diseases for months or even years after being sick with measles. If a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. The only way to stop measles is to prevent it through vaccination. Measles vaccine is safe and effective. Two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MR/measles-rubella) provide 97% protection from infection and the potentially serious consequences of the disease.

Mpox,What are the symptoms of mpox?,"Mpox can cause a range of signs and symptoms. While some people have less severe symptoms, others may develop more serious illness and need care in a health facility. Common symptoms of mpox include a rash which may last for 2–4 weeks. This may start with, or be followed by, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands (lymph nodes). The rash looks like blisters or sores, and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. These lesions may also be found in the mouth, throat, anus, rectum or vagina, or on the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to several thousand. Some people develop inflammation inside the rectum (proctitis) that can cause severe pain, as well as inflammation of the genitals that may cause difficulties urinating. In most cases, the symptoms of mpox go away on their own within a few weeks with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever. However, in some people, the illness can be severe or lead to complications and even death. Newborn babies, children, people who are pregnant and people with underlying immune deficiencies such as from advanced HIV disease may be at higher risk of more serious mpox disease and death. Severe disease due to mpox may include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood, and lung infections. Complications can include severe bacterial infection from skin lesions, mpox affecting the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia), and eye problems. People with severe mpox may require hospitalization, supportive care and antiviral medicines to reduce the severity of lesions and shorten time to recovery. According to available data, between 0.1% and 10% of people with mpox have died. It is important to note that death rates in different settings may differ due to several factors, such as access to health care and underlying immunosuppression, including because of undiagnosed HIV or advanced HIV disease.

Mpox,How does mpox spread?,"From person to person: Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). During the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions. People with mpox are considered infectious until all their lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath, and all the lesions on the eyes and in the body (in the mouth, throat, eyes, vagina and anus) have healed too, which usually takes from 2 to 4 weeks. It is also possible for the virus to persist for some time on clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. Someone else who touches these items may become infected, particularly if they have any cuts or abrasions or touch their eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous membranes without first washing their hands. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces/objects and cleaning your hands after touching surfaces/objects that may be contaminated can help prevent this type of transmission. The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, there is still limited information on whether the virus can be transmitted from someone with the virus before they get symptoms or after their lesions have healed. Although live virus has been isolated from semen, we do not yet know the extent to which infection can spread through semen, vaginal fluids, amniotic fluids, breastmilk or blood. From animals to humans: Someone who comes into physical contact with an animal which carries the virus, such as some species of monkeys or a terrestrial rodent (such as the tree squirrel) may also develop mpox. Exposure by such physical contact with an animal or meat can occur through bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping or preparing a meal. The virus can also be caught through eating contaminated meat which is not cooked thoroughly. The risk of getting mpox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In countries where animals carry the virus, any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating. From humans to animals: There have been a few reports of the virus being identified in pet dogs. However, it has not been confirmed whether these were true infections or whether the detection of virus was related to surface contamination. Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings. People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including pets (such as cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils), livestock and wildlife. More detailed advice for pet owners and persons working with animals can be found in the WOAH risk guidance on reducing spillback of monkeypox virus . WHO continues to work with its One Health partners, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), to learn more about the natural reservoir of the virus and help countries to reduce the risk of mpox transmission from or to animals.

The risk of getting mpox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In countries where animals carry the virus, any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating.
There have been a few reports of the virus being identified in pet dogs. However, it has not been confirmed whether these were true infections or whether the detection of virus was related to surface contamination.
Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings. People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including pets (such as cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils), livestock and wildlife.
More detailed advice for pet owners and persons working with animals can be found in the WOAH risk guidance on reducing spillback of monkeypox virus .
WHO continues to work with its One Health partners, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), to learn more about the natural reservoir of the virus and help countries to reduce the risk of mpox transmission from or to animals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mpox
Mpox,Who is at risk of mpox?,"People who have close contact with someone who has mpox are at risk of infection. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). People who have contact with clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and other surfaces that have been touched by someone with mpox are also at risk. Anyone living with someone who has mpox should take steps to reduce the risk of becoming infected. A person who has been diagnosed with mpox should be assessed by a health care provider to determine if they are well enough to be cared for at home and if isolation can be safely managed at home. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox (by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharps such as needles).

Mpox,"Are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men at higher risk of contracting mpox?","The risk of mpox is not limited to people who are sexually active or gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who has symptoms is at risk and any person with multiple sex partners is also at risk. Most of the cases that were reported in the multi-country outbreak in 2022/2023 were identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Given that the virus moves from person to person in these sexual networks in many countries, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men may be at higher risk of being exposed if they have sex or other form of close contact with someone who is infectious.

Mpox,How can I protect myself and others against mpox?,"To protect yourself and others against mpox, know the signs and symptoms, how the virus spreads, what to do if you get ill, and the risk in your area or community. If the virus is spreading in your area or in your community, have open conversations with those you come into close contact with about any symptoms you or they may have. Avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox, including sexual contact. Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you think you might have mpox, you can act to protect others by seeking medical advice and isolating from others until you have been evaluated and tested. If you have mpox, you should isolate yourself from others until all your lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath. This will stop you from passing on the virus to others. Follow your local health authority instructions on isolation at home or in a health facility. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered.

Mpox,What do we know about mpox and sex?,"Mpox can spread through close contact of any kind, including through kissing, touching, oral and penetrative vaginal or anal sex with someone who is infectious. People who have sex with multiple or new partners are most at risk. Anyone with new and unusual rashes or lesions should avoid having sex or any other kind of close contact with other people until they have been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mpox. Remember that the rash can also be found in places that can be hard to see inside the body, including the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina and anus/anal area. If mpox is spreading through sex in your community or area, consider reducing your risk until the outbreak is brought under control by: openly communicating with partners about mpox symptoms and risks; exchanging contact details with sexual partners so that you can inform each other if you do develop symptoms; taking a break from having sex; reducing your number of new sexual partners, one off sexual partners, or anonymous sexual partners; consistently using condoms; avoiding group sex; avoiding sex-on-premises venues (such as cruising bars, saunas, darkrooms, commercial sex venues or any premises where sex is exchanged for money); avoiding using alcohol or drugs in sexual contexts (including chemsex); and, where and when available, by taking up the offer of vaccines. While the monkeypox virus has been found in semen, it is currently not known whether mpox can be spread through semen or vaginal fluids. Wearing a condom won’t fully protect you from mpox, but it may reduce your risk or extent of exposure and it will help protect you and others from HIV and a range of other STIs. People with mpox are advised to use condoms for 12 weeks after they recover.

Mpox,I have mpox. What can I do to protect other people from getting infected?,"If you have mpox, your healthcare provider will advise you on what to do while you recover. Follow national advice on whether you should recover at home or if you need care in a health facility. In the meantime, it is important to avoid having close contact with others until your lesions have completely healed. If you are advised to isolate at home, protect those you live with as much as possible by: asking friends and family to help you by delivering things you need; isolating in a separate room; using a separate bathroom, or cleaning any surfaces you touched after each use; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces with soap and water and a household disinfectant; avoiding sweeping/vacuuming (this might disturb virus particles and cause others to become infected); using separate utensils, objects, electronics, or clean well with soap and water/disinfectant before sharing; not sharing towels, bedding or clothes; doing your own laundry (lift bedding, clothes and towels carefully without shaking them, put materials in a plastic bag before carrying it to the washing machine and wash them with hot water over 60 degrees Celsius); opening windows for good ventilation; and encouraging everyone in the house to clean their hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If you cannot avoid being in the same room as someone else or having close contact with another person while isolating at home, then do your best to limit their risk by: avoiding touching each other; cleaning your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; covering your rash with clothing or bandages (until you can isolate again – your rash will heal best if uncovered); opening windows throughout the home; ensuring you and anyone in the room with you wear well-fitting medical masks; and maintaining at least 1 metre of distance from others.

Mpox,What care does someone with mpox need to recover fully?,"The care someone needs will depend on their symptoms and their risk of developing more severe disease. People with mpox should follow the advice of their health care provider. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever (such as analgesics and antipyretics). It is important for anyone with mpox who is recovering at home to stay hydrated, eat well and get enough sleep. People who are self-isolating should take care of their mental health by doing things they find relaxing and enjoyable, staying connected to loved ones using technology, exercising if they feel well enough and can do so while isolating, and asking for support with their mental health if they need it. People with mpox should avoid scratching their skin and take care of their rash by cleaning their hands before and after touching lesions and keeping skin dry and uncovered (unless they are unavoidably in a room with someone else, in which case they should cover it with clothing or a bandage until they are able to isolate again). The rash can be kept clean with sterilized water or antiseptic. Saltwater rinses can be used for sores in the mouth, and warm baths with baking soda and Epsom salts can ease the discomfort of sores on the body. Paracetamol can be used to help manage the pain caused by lesions, if needed. If stronger pain medicine is needed, advice should be sought from a health care provider.

Mpox,What should I do if a child in my care has mpox?,"Children can catch mpox if they have close contact with someone who has symptoms. Children can be exposed to the virus at home from siblings, parents, caregivers, or other family members through close contact. In some settings in Africa, children and adolescents may be exposed through hunting or trapping activities or consumption of insufficiently cooked meat. Adolescents who have engaged in sexual activity with someone with mpox can also be exposed. The mpox rash can at first resemble other common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and other viral infections. If a child you are caring for has symptoms that could be mpox, seek advice from a healthcare provider. They will help to get them tested, and to access the care they need. Children may be at greater risk of severe mpox than adults. They should be closely monitored until they have recovered in case they need additional care. A health worker responsible for the child may advise that they are cared for in a health facility. In this situation, a parent or caregiver who is healthy and at low risk of mpox will be allowed to stay with them. If you have confirmed or suspected mpox and you are breastfeeding, talk to your healthcare provider for advice. They will assess the risk of transmitting mpox as well as the risk of withholding breastfeeding from your infant. If it is possible for you to continue to breastfeed and have close contact, they will advise you on how to reduce the risk by taking other measures, including covering up lesions. The risk of infection will need to be carefully balanced with the potential harm and distress caused by interrupting breastfeeding and close contact between parent and child. It is not yet known whether the monkeypox virus can be spread from parent to child through breastmilk; this is an area in need of further study.

Mpox,Are people who are immunosuppressed at higher risk of developing severe mpox (including people living with HIV)?,"Persons with immune suppression are at higher risk of developing severe mpox or dying. Severe mpox can include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), conditions such as inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs, or secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections. People with advanced HIV disease (late presentation, low CD4 count and high HIV viral load) have an elevated risk of death if they develop severe mpox. This is more common in people with HIV status unknown prior to a diagnosis of mpox. People living with HIV who achieve viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment do not appear to be at any higher risk of severe mpox than the general population. Use of daily effective HIV treatment (antiretrovirals or ARVs) reduces the risk of developing severe mpox symptoms in the case of infection. People with untreated HIV and advanced HIV disease may be immunocompromised and therefore be at greater risk of severe mpox. WHO advises countries to integrate HIV and mpox testing, prevention and care. People who are sexually active and who do not know their HIV status are advised to seek a test for HIV. People living with HIV on effective treatment have the same life expectancy as their HIV negative peers. Severe mpox cases seen in some countries highlight the urgent need to increase equitable access to mpox diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics, and to HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Without this, most affected groups are being left without the tools they need to protect their sexual health and well-being. If you are living with HIV, continue to take your HIV medication as directed. If you think you may have mpox, seek medical advice. If you think you are at risk for mpox or have been diagnosed with mpox, you may benefit from testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you don’t know your HIV status, ask your health worker for an HIV test. This will help your health care provider to ensure you receive the best possible care.

Mpox,"Can I get mpox during social events, parties or other gatherings? How can I reduce my risk?","Anyone attending a gathering is at risk of contracting mpox if they come into close contact with someone with mpox. Mpox can spread through skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and by being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). Mpox can also spread through contact with contaminated materials or objects such as sheets or needles. Crowded gatherings where people are close together, or where people spend an extended time together in a closed space, carry more risk. To reduce the risk of transmission at gatherings, avoid close contact, including sexual contact, with anyone showing symptoms of mpox. If you develop symptoms isolate yourself, ensuring you avoid any close contact with others, and seek professional medical advice. Consider vaccination if you are at high risk of exposure, based on a healthcare provider's recommendation.

Mpox can spread through skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and by being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). Mpox can also spread through contact with contaminated materials or objects such as sheets or needles.
Crowded gatherings where people are close together, or where people spend an extended time together in a closed space, carry more risk.
To reduce the risk of transmission at gatherings, avoid close contact, including sexual contact, with anyone showing symptoms of mpox. If you develop symptoms isolate yourself, ensuring you avoid any close contact with others, and seek professional medical advice. Consider vaccination if you are at high risk of exposure, based on a healthcare provider's recommendation.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mpox
Mpox,I’ve had mpox in the past. Can I catch it again?,"Our understanding of how long immunity following mpox lasts continues to evolve. There have been some cases of second infections reported. A few people may get mpox despite having had it before. Even if you have had mpox in the past, you should be doing everything you can to avoid getting re-infected. If you have had mpox in the past and someone in your household has it now, you can protect others by being the designated caregiver, as you are more likely to have some immunity than others. However, you should still take all precautions to avoid exposure as far as possible.

Mpox,What are the different virus clades and how do they differ in impact?,"There are two broad clades of the virus: clade I and II. Clade II was behind the global mpox outbreak that began in 2022. The current understanding is that clade I leads to more severe disease and death than clade II in the populations where it is endemic. However, differences in the features of past outbreaks such as population groups affected make it hard to draw a firm conclusion. Public health advice from WHO applies for prevention and management of mpox arising from either clade. A new offshoot of clade I virus, called clade Ib, was first reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023, and has been spreading through sex and other types of close contact. Studies are underway to understand the properties of this new strain.

Obesity and overweight,What are the health consequences of being overweight?,"Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health.
 Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as 
cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 
diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some 
cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause 
premature death and substantial disability. What is not widely known is that the risk of health problems 
starts when someone is only very slightly overweight, and that the 
likelihood of problems increases as someone becomes more and more 
overweight. Many of these conditions cause long-term suffering for 
individuals and families. In addition, the costs for the health care 
system can be extremely high. The good news is that overweight and obesity are largely 
preventable. The key to success is to achieve an energy balance between 
calories consumed on one hand, and calories used on the other hand. To reach this goal, people can limit energy intake from total 
fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated 
fats; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, 
whole grains and nuts; and limit their intake of sugars. And to increase
 calories used,  people can boost  their levels of physical activity - 
to at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most 
days. Related links Diet and physical activity: a public health priority

The key barriers to delivering access to oral health services for all include the following. High out-of-pocket expenditures for oral health care often lead to catastrophic costs and significant financial burden for families and communities. The provision of oral health services largely relies on highly specialized providers using expensive high-tech equipment and materials, and these services are not well integrated with primary health care models. Poor information and surveillance systems, combined with low priority for public oral health research are major bottlenecks to developing more effective oral health interventions and policies.

Plague,What are the types of plague and how do people become infected?,"There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the
 route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and 
curable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally
 and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. 
pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to 
the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then 
becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ""bubo"". At advanced
 stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores 
filled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare.
 Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more 
severe type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most 
virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any 
person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to 
other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated 
early, is fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and 
treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms).

Plague,What are the symptoms of plague?,"Symptoms typically include sudden onset fever, chills, head and 
body aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Painful and inflamed lymph
 nodes can also appear during bubonic plague. Symptoms of the pneumonic

include severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and 
coughing, often with blood-tainted sputum.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/plague
Plague,How does pneumonic differ from bubonic plague?,"Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague, but cannot be 
easily transmitted between people. Some people with bubonic plague will 
develop pneumonic plague, meaning the infection spreads to their lungs. 
Pneumonic plague can be transmitted between people through coughing. 
Bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30% to 60%, while the pneumonic

Poliomyelitis,What is variant (vaccine-derived) polio?,"Circulating variant (vaccine-derived) poliovirus, are rare, but such strains have been increasing in recent years due to low immunization rates within communities. cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) are the most prevalent. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) that has brought the wild poliovirus to the brink of eradication has many benefits: the live attenuated (weakened) vaccine virus provides better immunity in the gut, which is where polio replicates. The vaccine virus is also excreted in the stool, and in communities with low-quality sanitation, this means that it can be spread from person to person and actually help protect the community. However, in communities with low immunization rates, as the virus is spread from one unvaccinated child to another over a long period of time (often over the course of about 12–18 months), it can mutate and take on a form that can cause paralysis just like the wild poliovirus. This mutated poliovirus can then spread in communities, leading to cVDPVs. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. Well over 20 million cases have been averted since large-scale administration of OPV began when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched. Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus.

Poliomyelitis,What is the difference between oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)?,"The development of effective vaccines to prevent paralytic polio was one of the major medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative uses two types of vaccine to stop polio transmission – inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). If enough people in a community are immunized against polio, the virus will be deprived of susceptible hosts and will die out. High levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks occurring. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is constantly assessing the optimal use of the different types of vaccine to prevent paralytic polio and stop poliovirus transmission in different areas of the world. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is safe and extremely effective, and the most common kind of vaccine used in the fight to eradicate polio. There are different types of OPVs that protect against one, a combination of two, or all three different serotypes of polio – types 1, 2, and/or 3. Unlike the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), OPV has a unique ability to stop person-to-person spread of poliovirus. Additionally, it is easier to administer and can be distributed quickly on a large scale. The use of OPV has helped reduce global polio cases by over 99% since 1988, and it remains a vital tool in the effort to end polio everywhere. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was developed in 1955 by Dr Jonas Salk. Also called the Salk vaccine IPV consists of inactivated (killed) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. IPV is given by intramuscular or intradermal injection and needs to be administered by a trained health worker. IVP produces antibodies in the blood to all three types of poliovirus. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis.

OPVs are safe and effective and offer long lasting protection for individuals against the serotype(s) which they target. For several weeks after vaccination the vaccine virus replicates in the intestine, is excreted and can be spread to others in close contact. This means that immunization with OPV can result in ‘passive’ immunization of people who have not been vaccinated. OPVs are administered orally and do not require health professionals, sterile needle syringes or a complex cold chain system. As such, OPVs are easy to administer in large-scale vaccination campaigns and to transport to hard-to-reach areas. Disadvantages OPV is safe and effective. However, in extremely rare cases (at a rate of approximately 1 in 2.7 million doses) the weakened vaccine-virus in OPV can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). The extremely low risk of VAPP is accepted by public health programmes given the strong protection OPV otherwise provides. In places where not enough children are immunized against polio, the weakened vaccine-virus can pass through the community and, in rare instances over time, genetically revert to a form that can cause paralysis. This is known as variant poliovirus, or cVDPV.

Poliomyelitis,What are advantages and disadvantages of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)?,"Advantages As IPV is not a ‘live’ vaccine, it carries no risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). IPV triggers an excellent protective immune response in most people. Disadvantages IPV induces very low levels of immunity in the intestine. As a result, when a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the faeces, risking continued circulation. IPV is over five times more expensive than OPV. Administering the vaccine requires trained health workers, as well as sterile injection equipment and procedures. Safety IPV is one of the safest vaccines in use. No serious systemic adverse reactions have been shown to follow vaccination. Efficacy IPV is highly effective in preventing paralytic disease caused by all three types of poliovirus.

Poliomyelitis,Which polio vaccine is recommended?,"An increasing number of industrialized, polio-free countries are using IPV as the vaccine of choice. This is because the risk of paralytic polio associated with continued routine use of OPV is deemed greater than the risk of imported wild virus. However, as IPV does not stop transmission of the virus, OPV is used wherever a polio outbreak needs to be contained, even in countries which rely exclusively on IPV for their routine immunization programme. Once polio has been eradicated, use of all OPV will need to be stopped to prevent re-establishment of transmission due to VDPVs.

Primary health care,What is primary health care?,"Primary health care is about health at all ages. It involves prevention, health promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. This approach empowers people and communities to choose healthier lifestyles, prevent diseases, and access early detection, treatment and recovery services. Primary health care is not about building specific health facilities. It is an overall approach to strengthening national health systems to respond to people’s essential health needs more effectively. Primary health care goes beyond primary care, which is a subset of primary health care and refers to essential, first-contact care provided in a community setting such as community health posts. It ensures that people receive support closer to their everyday environments and are referred to secondary or tertiary care facilities, including hospitals, when the need arises. Primary health care encompasses 3 aspects: multisectoral policy and action to address the broader determinants of health; empowering individuals, families and communities; and meeting people’s essential health needs throughout their lives.

Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others: Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health. Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence. Physical environment – safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health. Employment and working conditions – people in employment are healthier, particularly those who have more control over their working conditions Social support networks – greater support from families, friends and communities is linked to better health. Culture - customs and traditions, and the beliefs of the family and community all affect health. Genetics - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses. Personal behaviour and coping skills – balanced eating, keeping active, smoking, drinking, and how we deal with life’s stresses and challenges all affect health. Health services - access and use of services that prevent and treat disease influences health Gender - Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages.

Social determinants of health,How does evidence-based approach work within health impact assessment?,"An evidence base about the impact that projects, programmes and policies have had on health is required to carry out health impact assessment (HIA). The best available evidence is used within the appraisal stage of HIA to determine what impacts may occur (both positive and negative), the size of the impact (if possible) and the distribution of that impact in different population groups. It is generally assumed that the evidence for health impacts exists, and that searching and collating will provide the necessary evidence. Unfortunately this is not often the case, and the evidence of health impacts is often not available. This is because of the long causal pathway between the implementation of a project/programme/policy and any potential impact on population health, and the many confounding factors that make the determination of a link difficult. Within the HIA it is important therefore to be explicit about sources of evidence and to identify missing or incomplete information. Providing a comprehensive review of the evidence base is not simple. It needs to draw on the best available evidence – that from reviews and research papers, and including qualitative and quantitative evidence. This information must be supplemented with local and expert knowledge, policy information, and proposal specific information. However, there are examples where the best available evidence has been documented, and in some cases summarised.

Tetanus,Should tetanus immunizations be given to survivors with injuries in emergency situations?,"In emergency situations where there are serious injuries, tetanus immunization has to be taken into consideration. As tetanus is a complication of wounds and injuries, it is essential that injured people receive appropriate surgical and medical care of contaminated open wounds. Open wounds must be considered as contaminated and should not be closed. Debridement and removal of dead tissue and debris is essential, and depending on the size of the wound may necessitate a surgical procedure undertaken in appropriate conditions. Wounds should be dressed with sterile dressings and the patient scheduled for delayed primary closure. Tetanus immunization is usually provided to victims of natural disasters on an as-needed basis for several reasons. In addition, passive immunization using TIG, preferably of human origin, may be needed for prophylaxis in cases of dirty wounds in incompletely immunized patients. TIG is essential in the treatment and prophylaxis of tetanus cases and should be readily available in all countries. Types of tetanus vaccines TT - Tetanus Toxoid vaccine DTP - Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine DT - Diphtheria toxoid and Tetanus toxoid vaccine Td - Tetanus toxoid and Diphtheria toxoid vaccine (low dose diphtheria) First, it is not communicable from person-to-person. Second, in many parts of the world, most people have already some protection against tetanus through immunization. In summary, tetanus prevention can be achieved during emergencies through: Careful cleaning of wounds, both deep and superficial, can substantially decrease the risk of tetanus. Protecting cleaned wounds from recontamination with dressings, and/or topical disinfectants also is important. Protective clothing and closed shoes, if available, should be worn by anyone engaged in clearing away or sifting through debris. If possible, TT vaccination should be offered to anyone engaged in debris clean-up and construction. For those who have not received TT in the past, or for whom past vaccination is uncertain, a second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first. The first dose will not provide protection to those who have not previously been vaccinated, but will rather prime the body to produce anti-tetanus immunity with the second dose given at-least 4 weeks later. If feasible, vaccination with TT-containing vaccine should be offered to all internally displaced people who have not received at least 3 previous doses. Because tetanus risk is high in disaster areas, and because the immunization status of most persons will be unknown, it will be worthwhile to provide doses of TT-containing vaccine, even if only one dose can be assured. Tetanus immunoglobulins may be required for managing those with deep wounds. In emergencies where prior tetanus toxoid immunization levels were low, special attention should be given to preventing maternal and neonatal tetanus, by immunizing women of childbearing age and by improving the hygienic conditions under which childbirths take place. Routine immunization of women and children should also be re-established as soon as possible.

Trachoma,What is trachoma?,"Trachoma is a disease of the eye and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis . After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical.

Trachoma,How is trachoma diagnosed?,"Trachoma is usually clinically diagnosed. People are examined for clinical signs by trained graders using magnifiers (loupes) and illumination from either the sun or a good torch. Conjunctival infection with ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis (the cause of trachoma) does not always generate visible signs of disease. However, infection can be accompanied by signs of inflammation known as active trachoma, and as it progresses through its natural history, trachoma becomes more and more obvious on examination. Repeated episodes of inflammation cause scarring of the conjunctiva that can progress to drying of the eye and in-turning of the eyelashes. The latter is known as trachomatous trichiasis. This can abrade the eyeball, causing constant profound irritation, reflex spasm of the eyelids and opacification of the cornea.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/trachoma
Trachoma,What are the clinical signs and how can trachoma be treated?,"Ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as active trachoma. The WHO simplified trachoma grading system includes five signs. Treatment involves antibiotics to clear infection and surgery for the most advanced cases. Signs and their associated treatment are listed below. Trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) – The presence of five or more follicles, each at least 0.5 mm in diameter, in the central part of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Management: Give antibiotics (single-dose oral azithromycin 20mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 1g, or 1% topical tetracycline eye ointment into both eyes twice a day for six weeks). Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Trachomatous inflammation–intense (TI) – Pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels. Management: Give antibiotics (regimens as above). Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Trachomatous scarring (TS) – The presence of easily visible scarring in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Scars are white lines, bands, or sheets. Management: There is no specific treatment for this sign. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) – At least one eyelash from the upper eyelid touches the eyeball, or evidence of recent epilation of in-turned eyelashes from the upper eyelid. Management: Measure visual acuity. Refer the individual to the nearest eye unit for management, which might involve eyelid surgery or regular epilation. Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Corneal opacity (CO) – Easily visible corneal opacity that is so dense that at least part of the pupil margin is blurred when viewed through the opacity. Vision is likely to be affected. Management: Measure visual acuity. Refer the individual to the nearest eye unit for management, which should involve management of TT if still present.

Ultraviolet radiation,"What is the difference between UVA, UVB and UVC?","The three types of UV radiation are classified according to their wavelength. They differ in their biological activity and the extent to which they can penetrate the skin. The shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the UV radiation. However, shorter wavelength UV radiation is less able to penetrate the skin. The UV region covers the wavelength range 100-400 nm and is divided into three bands: UVA (315-400 nm) UVB (280-315 nm) UVC (100-280 nm). Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface. Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere. The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers.

Ultraviolet radiation,Which environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure?,"Time of year and time of day UV levels vary mainly with the height of the sun in the sky and in mid-latitudes are highest during the summer months during the 4-hour period around solar noon. During these times the sun's rays take the most direct path to earth. In contrast, during early morning or late afternoon hours the sun's rays pass at a greater angle through the atmosphere. Much more UV radiation is absorbed and less reaches the Earth. Latitude UV levels are higher closer to the equator. Closer to the equator the sun's rays have a shorter distance to travel through the atmosphere and therefore less of the harmful UV radiation can be absorbed. Altitude With increasing altitude less atmosphere is available to absorb UV radiation. With every 1000 m in altitude, UV levels increase by approximately 10 per cent. Clouds and haze Be careful not to underestimate the amount of UV radiation passing through clouds. Many surfaces reflect UV radiation and add to the overall UV levels you experience. While grass, soil or water reflect less than 10 per cent of incident UV radiation, sand reflects about 15 per cent, and sea foam about 25 per cent. Fresh snow is a particularly good reflector and almost doubles a person's UV exposure. Recurring incidences of snow blindness or photokeratitis in skiers emphasize that UV protective measures must take ground reflection into account. UV levels are highest under cloudless skies, and cloud cover generally reduces a person's exposure. However, light or thin clouds have little effect and may even enhance UV levels because of scattering. Don't be fooled by an overcast day or a cool breeze! Even a long stay in open shade, for example between buildings, may give a sensitive person a sunburn on a day with high UV levels. Ozone Ozone absorbs some of the UV radiation that would otherwise 
reach the Earth’s surface. Ozone levels vary over the year and even 
across the day. Ground reflection UV radiation is reflected or scattered to 
varying extents by different surfaces, e.g. snow can reflect as much as 
80% of UV radiation, dry beach sand about 15%, and sea foam about 25%.

Rapid point-of-care tests that can be used in the field are widely available. However, most of them are treponemal-based and cannot distinguish between past and current infection. Recently dual treponemal and nontreponemal rapid tests have become available, thus simplifying diagnosis in the field. These tests are able to detect both present and past infections to guide treatment of people with active infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the organisms in the skin lesions.

Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex and has been detected in semen, blood, urine, amniotic fluids, saliva as well as body fluids found in the brain and spinal cord.
Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. People who have donated blood are encouraged to report to the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus infection within 14 days after blood donation.

Zika virus,What are the characteristics of an ideal Zika vaccine?,"WHO is helping to shape vaccine development through the creation of a target product profile for Zika vaccines for use in an emergency. The profile specifies the preferred and minimal product characteristics for such vaccines. For example, administration of a single dose of Zika vaccine is preferable, but up to 2 doses are acceptable. The vaccine should protect for at least one year in an emergency context, but protection for several years is preferable. The shelf life of a vaccine should be at least 12 months at less than 20°C. Target product profile

Zika virus,What are the challenges in Zika vaccine R&D?,"Developing a Zika vaccine is complex. For example, we still face many unknowns about Zika virus disease and its complications. Evaluating candidate vaccines in areas with low Zika virus transmission is not easy. We need to develop diagnostic tests which can differentiate Zika infection from other similar viral infections. Getting a safe and effective Zika vaccine to women of childbearing age could, however, be technically feasible based on experience with vaccine development for other similar viruses, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/zika
Zika virus,What happens once a vaccine is available?,"Once a vaccine is available, WHO’s leading advisory group on immunization, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, performs a comprehensive review of the evidence and makes recommendations to the WHO Director-General for the optimal use of a vaccine for public health impact. WHO issues official recommendations based on the SAGE recommendations, which permit the prequalification and purchase by UN agencies.",https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/zika
Zika virus,Can women transmit Zika virus to their fetuses during pregnancy or childbirth?,"Transmission of Zika virus from pregnant women to their fetuses has been documented. Although Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, an unusual increase in cases of congenital microcephaly and other neurological complications in areas where outbreaks have occurred has significantly raised concern for pregnant women and their families, as well as among health providers and policy-makers. Pregnant women in general, including those who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection, should see their health-care provider for close monitoring of their pregnancy.

Zika virus,What should women do if they wish to postpone pregnancy because they are worried about microcephaly?,"Whether and when to become pregnant should be a personal decision, made on the basis of full information and access to affordable, quality health services. Women wanting to postpone pregnancy should have access to a comprehensive range of reversible, long- or short-acting contraceptive options. They should also be counselled on the dual protection against sexually transmitted infections provided by condoms. There are no known safety concerns regarding the use of any hormonal or barrier contraceptive methods for women or adolescent girls at risk of Zika virus, women diagnosed with Zika virus infection, or women and adolescents being treated for Zika virus infection.

Zika virus,How can women manage their pregnancy in the context of Zika virus and complications?,"Most women in Zika-affected areas will give birth to normal infants. Early ultrasound does not reliably predict fetal malformations. WHO recommends a repeat ultrasound of the fetus in the late second or early third trimester (preferably between 28 and 30 weeks) to identify fetal microcephaly and/or other brain abnormalities when they are easier to detect. Where feasible, screening of amniotic fluid for abnormalities and congenital infections, including Zika virus, is recommended, especially in cases where women test negative for Zika, but their ultrasounds indicate fetal brain abnormalities. Based on the prognosis of associated fetal brain abnormalities, the woman—and her partner if she wishes—should be offered non-directive counselling so that she, in consultation with her health-care provider, can make a fully informed choice about the next steps in the management of her pregnancy. Women carrying their pregnancy to term should receive appropriate care and support to manage anxiety, stress and the birth environment. Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available. Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available. Women, whatever their individual choices with respect to their pregnancies, must be treated with respect and dignity.

Zika virus,What is WHO's response to Zika?,"Zika virus and its complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome represent a new type of public health threat with long-term consequences for families, communities and countries. WHO and partners support countries in preparing for and responding to Zika to the fullest extent possible. The main pillars of their work, as outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Plan, July 2016 to December 2017, are: • Detection - Develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems for Zika virus disease, its neurological complications and other diseases that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This helps to measure burden of disease to guide sound public health interventions. • Prevention - Prevent complications associated with Zika virus infection through mosquito control that prevents the Aedes mosquito from transmitting Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever to humans; communicate risks to people’s health and engage communities in prevention activities. • Care and support - Strengthen health and social systems to provide appropriate services and support to individuals, families and communities affected by Zika and related complications. • Research – 1) Generate data and evidence needed to strengthen public health and community guidance and interventions to prevent, detect and control Zika virus infection and to manage its complications. 2) Fast track and scale up the research, development and availability of Aedes mosquito control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines. • Coordination – WHO coordinates the Zika response through close collaboration with more than 60 partners and facilitates information sharing among them and with countries.

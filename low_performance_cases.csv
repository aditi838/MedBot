What is the current health risk to people residing in contaminated areas?,"Currently, concentrations of radioactive caesium (Cs-137) in agricultural food products produced in
areas affected by the Chernobyl fallout are generally below national and international standards for
actions. In some limited areas with high radionuclide contamination (e.g. in parts of the Gomel and
Mogilev regions in Belarus and the Bryansk region in the Russian Federation) or areas with organic
poor soils (the Zhytomir and Rovno regions in Ukraine), milk may still be produced with activity
concentrations of Cs-137 that exceed national standards for action (100 Becquerel per kilogram). In
these areas, countermeasures and environmental remediation may still be warranted.

What illnesses can affect people living with HIV?,"ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives by ensuring that their immune system remains healthy. In certain settings, however, many people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, not on treatment, or not taking consistent treatment, and, as a result their HIV disease progresses. People with HIV who develop severe immunodeficiency and are not on antiretroviral treatment frequently develop severe opportunistic infections and some rare cancers as Kaposi Sarcoma. Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one cause of death among people living with HIV in Africa, and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Routine TB-symptom screening and early initiation of ART can greatly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Other common HIV coinfections include hepatitis B and C in some populations. HIV infection can result in a range of health problems. As people living with HIV age and live longer, non-AIDS defining illnesses are becoming more common. These include heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

All women and girls should have ready access to emergency contraception, including accurate information and counselling as well as affordable methods.
Fact sheet: Emergency contraception","That's a very valid concern! Zika virus can be transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, and if a woman is infected, it can increase the risk of microcephaly and other birth defects in the fetus.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), women who have been exposed to Zika through sexual contact should consider the following steps:

1. **Emergency Contraception (EC)**: If you've had unprotected sex, take EC pills like Plan B or ella. These pills can help prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex. However, EC is not a substitute for regular contraception.
2. **Get Tested for Zika**: If you've been exposed, get tested for the virus. The CDC recommends testing for Zika IgM antibodies, which can indicate recent infection. However, this test may not detect the virus if you're asymptomatic or if the infection occurred more than a week prior.
3. **Use Condoms Correctly**: Until you're certain you're not infected, use condoms correctly and every time you have sex. This will reduce the risk of transmission.
4. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: Reach out to your healthcare provider or a sexual health clinic for guidance on EC, testing, and contraception. They will help you determine the best course of action based on your individual situation.
5. **Prevent Zika Transmission**: Take steps to prevent mosquito bites, as Zika can also be transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.

It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and care. They will help you make informed decisions about your reproductive health and provide the necessary support throughout this process.
